# Code for receptor paper
All code used for producing the data and generating figures in manuscript titled 
"Receptor localization maximizes information acquisition in natural cell environments". 
Code organized in folders corresponding to the figure they are associated with. In each folder, 
executing the `run_script.m` file will generate all corresponding data and figure.

For example, in the folder `figure_5`, executing the `run_script.m` script will produce all data associated
with figure 5 in the manuscript, and use those data to generate all panels in figure 5.

Exception: in the `run_script.m` file for figure 2, there are two sections that requires R scripts to be run 
(`env_LGCP.R`, `soil_gen_var.R`), check `run_script.m` to see how to manually run the R script.

All data and code have also been uploaded onto the Caltech data repository.
